# esx_taximeter
As I saw lots of peope having problems with the existing scripts I did some changes to esx_taximeter.
Updated and shortened version of the Taximeter hud from Damen 57 modified by Dexter.

________________________Hotkey__________________________
If you want to change the key setting open client/main.lua and search for 170.
Replace it with one of those controls : https://docs.fivem.net/game-references/controls/

________________________Jobs__________________________
With my version its limited to the taxi job, you can add another if line if you want more jobs, I can do some examples later.
I might go back to getting it from the config but this was more functional for now.

________________________Config__________________________
I left in some config options, should be self explanatory.
You can still change mi to km and the restricted vehicle classes etc.

Enjoy!
