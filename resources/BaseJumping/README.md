# Credits
`American1` (FiveM Profile Link): https://forum.fivem.net/u/American1. `BossManNz` for the modification.

# Disclaimer
I did not own nor do I claim his is my script, I simply used resources available on the FiveM forums, I simply just modified the existing script uploaded by `American1` to add a little more functionality.

# Description
This is a very simple script that in a nutshell gives you a parachute in exchange for $50 (this is configurable in the server.lua at line 28 and 30). There are locations on the map (that are marked with blips) so you know where they all are. Simply go to these locations, stand in the marker, press E and then jump. Make sure that when you jump, you left click to activate your Parachute.

Additionally, you may set the config on line 14 of the server.lua to enable/disable charing players for a Parachute.

# Dependencies
- pNotify.
- ESX Framework.

## Installation
