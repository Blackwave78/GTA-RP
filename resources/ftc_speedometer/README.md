# Speedometer
Simple speedometer!

## disclaimer
This is using a lot of part from the old ft_speedometer, so everything isn't coded by me.

## Requirments
	- ft_libs : https://github.com/FivemTools/ft_libs
	
## Configuration
	In configurations.lua :
 		kmhMode = true, (false to mph mode)
		RectAlpha = 100, ( 0 - 255)
  		SpeedAlpha = 150, ( 0 - 255)
  		AdvancedForPlane = true, ( false to keep the same speedometer in flying vehicle )
