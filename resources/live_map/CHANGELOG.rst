Changelog
=========


v2.2.12 (04-04-2018)
--------------------

Changes
~~~~~~~
- Removed Console Spam. [Avery Johnson]


v2.2.11 (16-01-2018)
--------------------

New
~~~
- Add license to update_check. [Jordan Dalton]
- Add license to reverse_location_hashes.lua. [Jordan Dalton]
- Add location to the player data. [Jordan Dalton]

  "Location" is a new data point sent to the interface. Should only be updated if the street, area or zone have changed when updating the new position.

Changes
~~~~~~~
- Update to version 2.2.11. [Jordan Dalton]
- Update the timer in update_check.lua. [Jordan Dalton]

  The checker now runs every 30 minutes regardless of whether it's the latest version or not.


v2.2.10 (06-01-2018)
--------------------

New
~~~
- Add reverse_car_hashes. [Jordan Dalton]

  Car names can now be reversed to their English names. You can change this by modifying the "reverse_car_hashes.lua" file.

  Also added a check to the reverse hash functions to make sure the hash being passed is a string.
- Added location display and more. [Tom Grobbe]

  Changes:
  - Replaced all `GetPlayerPed(-1)` with `PlayerPedId()`
  - Added `["Location"]` to the Blip DataSet, providing a default value.
  - The Location data will be shown on all player blips and will look like this:
  "Glory Way, East Vinewood (Los Santos)"
  (street name, area name, city/county)

Changes
~~~~~~~
- Update to version 2.2.10. [Jordan Dalton]
- Update client.lua with plate check. [Jordan Dalton]

  Vehicles that are spawned in are given the plate " FIVE M " so, now the map detects this and marks the plate with "(Spawned In)".

  Also, added "schwarze" to the hash table for the vehicles.. Turns out R* missed the r on the end :/
- Update client.lua to use new reverse function. [Jordan Dalton]

  The client.lua now uses the reverseVehicleHash function to get a "nice" vehicle name.
- Removed location data. [Jordan Dalton]

  The location strings were localised to the client thiis ment that Chinese players would be sending Chinese strrings to the interface.

  I might add this back in but, it would require another file like the "reverse_weapon_hash" file for location data. This would allow the server owners to translate the locations to their prefered language.

Fix

-------------------

Changes
~~~~~~~
- Update to v2.2.8. [Jordan Dalton]

  Thanks to glitch for pointing out my spelling mistakes (hence the "Fixed small mistake" and "Shhh." commits).
- Update where access-control is being written. [Jordan Dalton]

  Before, the access-control-origin was only being written when sending the blips, this fixes that so, the iterface can see any errors.

-------------------

New
~~~
- Add access-control to sockets. [Jordan Dalton]

v2.2.2 (02-11-2017)
-------------------

New
~~~
- Add more null checks to the API. [Jordan Dalton]

  Someone complained that they were crashing when null data was being sent to the API (specifically the `RemovePlayer`) so, I've added null checks to hopefully catch any null data being passed and not do anything with it.

  Hopefully this works...

- Add Unix configuration for building. [Jordan Dalton]

v2.2.0 (30-10-2017)
-------------------

New
~~~
- Add live blips. [Jordan Dalton]

  When blips are added and removed, they are now sent to the map so it can update itself.

  I've also added some commands to allow users to add/remove blips from in-game with `blip remove` and `blip add <sprite> [name] [description]`

  People are still getting errors about writing to sockets at the same time.. FFS.
- Add event handlers for blips. [Jordan Dalton]

  Added add/update/remove events for blips.

  They all take a dynamic object that represnts the blips to modify.

Changes
~~~~~~~
- Update version and changelog. [Jordan Dalton]

Fix
~~~
- Fixed native failing on restart. [Jordan Dalton]

  When the resource would restart with players on the server, there would be an error thrown. This is now fixed..

-------------------

Changes
~~~~~~~
- Update changelog. [Jordan Dalton]

Fix
~~~
- Fixed server freezing issues. [Jordan Dalton]

  So, apparently the old resource would freeze the server when players left and when writing. A bunch of shit would break it and freeze the main thread. This fixes those issues and should make the resource usable...

  The client list has now been changed to a ConcurrentDictionary because I thought my locks and stuff was breaking.. Turns out wasn't the problem.

  Also fixed a error where the "playerLeft" would trigger when a player isn't in the "playerData" object.
- Fixed changelog. [Jordan Dalton]

Other
~~~~~
- Merge branch 'develop' [Jordan Dalton]


v2.1.8 (24-10-2017)

Changes
~~~~~~~
- Update changelog. [Jordan Dalton]
- Update versions.json. [Jordan Dalton]

  Version is now 2.1.7

Fix
~~~
- Fixed race condition and null data. [Jordan Dalton]

  Added null checks to data being sent to the `AddPlayerData` and `UpdatePlayerData` functions to catch any errors cause by null variables.

  Tasks now wait until they have sent the data to one socket before sending data to the next.


v2.1.7 (21-10-2017)
-------------------

New
~~~
- Add error handling to update_check. [Jordan Dalton]

  Hopefully the user gets an error if the resource can't read the contents of "version.json".

Changes
~~~~~~~
- Update changelog. [Jordan Dalton]


v2.1.6 (20-10-2017)
-------------------

Changes
~~~~~~~

- Removed spammy prints. [Jordan Dalton]

  Server had some spammy prints.. They're gone now.
- Update changelog. [Jordan Dalton]

Fix
~~~
- Fixed clients crashing when player leaves. [Jordan Dalton]

  I think that players were continuing to send data to the server (e.g. to update their position) when they were no longer in the session after they had already been removed. Causing some funcky bugs. @davwheat said this eased the crashing so, here it is.

  Also, the updater now uses the version.json file for the current version (don't know why I didn't use that before).

Other
~~~~~
- Merge remote-tracking branch 'origin/master' [Jordan Dalton]
- Delete test.lua. [Jordan Dalton]

- Add better changelog. [Jordan Dalton]

  Hopefully this is nicer to deal with when geenerating and releasing changelogs.

Changes
~~~~~~~
- Removed spammy traces. [Jordan Dalton]

  When updating stuff, I would trace to console. This could create spam (espesially with frequently updated values).
- Update README. [Jordan Dalton]

  Documented the `blips generate` command. Some poeple might not have known about it otherwise.
- Update changelog. [Jordan Dalton]
- Update changelog. [Jordan Dalton]
- Update changelog file extension. [Jordan Dalton]

  Apparently Github doesn't render RST text normally so hopefully putting the file extension will make it nice and pretty.
- Update readme. [Jordan Dalton]

  Updated the readme to avoid confussion.. My bad.

Fix
~~~
- Fixed rare error. [Jordan Dalton]

  When a client disconnectes from the WS when the `SendWebsocketData` function is ran, an error is thrown.. It was pretty rare and I don't know if this has fixed it but, it looks like it should.

Other
~~~~~
- Merge pull request #9 from TGRHavoc/develop. [Jordan Dalton]

  Fixed listener only listening on loopback address

  The server Lua files now have comments and stuff. It's probably not the best but, it'll do.

  I'm done for the day.. Time to play some games :D
- Update socketHandler (Fixes #6) [Jordan Dalton]

  I wasn't locking the client list when sending them playerData, this lead to multiple writes being completed at the same time (the playerData and playerLeft).
- Update readme. [Jordan Dalton]

  Readme now contains some more relevant information, still needs to be fully-updated though.
- Update newtonsoft package. [Jordan Dalton]

  Didn't use the PCL version of the library, this should fix any issues with it running on Linux.
- Update changelog. [Jordan Dalton]

Fix
~~~
- Fixed debugLevel.None bug. [Jordan Dalton]

  Just added an extra check to the Log function to make sure that when "LogLevel.None" is used, no logs are shown.

  This keeps track of the following:
  - Player position
  - Vehicle (if in one)
  - License Plate (if in vehicle)
  - Weapon (uses a reverse hash function to get the name)
- Add reverse hash file. [Jordan Dalton]

  Added a file to make it easy to reverse a weapon's hash to get it's name. Also, something for the server owners to mess with f they want :P

  You can now remove players or ttheir data from the object that is sent via websockets.
